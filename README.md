Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro; born 5 February 1985, better known as Ronaldo, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward. He is the captain of the Portuguese national team and he is currently playing at Saudi Arabian football club Al Nassr at 38 years old.

He is considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time, and, by some, as the greatest ever. Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 34 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time. 

## Personal Life

**Family, children, and relationships**

Ronaldo has five children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her. In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.

Ronaldo became a father to twins, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez, who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017. The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.

Ronaldo's father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.

In January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that "the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract", but Saudi authorities have begun to "turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime".

Ronaldo is of Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother. He is a Roman Catholic.

**Health**

Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008. He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.

## Early Life

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in Funchal, Madeira Islands in early 1985 to Maria Dolores dos Santos and José Dinis Aveiro. He has one brother named Hugo, and two sisters named Katia and Elma. Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart (Tachycardia) at age 15 in 2000. In 1997, 12-year-old Ronaldo went on a trial with Sporting CP. He impressed the club enough to be signed for £1,500. He then moved from Funchal to Lisbon, to join the Sporting youth academy. In 1999, at age 14 he was expelled from school for throwing a chair at his teacher.

Growing up, Ronaldo idolized the Brazilian legends Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazário, and has described them as leaving "a beautiful history in football".
